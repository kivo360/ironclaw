# IronClaw Base Image — Fly.io deployment configuration
# This is the managed per-customer CRM container deployed by ironclaw-dashboard.
# The dashboard provisioner creates Fly Machines directly via API, so this config
# is primarily used for the initial `fly deploy` to push the image to the registry.
